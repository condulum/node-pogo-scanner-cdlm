Welcome to this node.js scanner app. This app targets at scanning nearby pokemons, by using the spawns.json generated by spawnScan.

The app can also look into the encountered pokemon and check its IV.

To use this, you first have to ```npm install```.

The things you can setup consists of: 

1. HTTPS Mode, to enable the webserver's HTTPS Mode
2. The server port, if you are using http instead.
3. Enabling telegram Alert, which sends the pokemon's info to a chat using a bot and the api key.
4. Setting up the api key for the bot
5. The path to ssl files (key and cert.)

Run ```node app``` or ```npm start``` to start the app.
